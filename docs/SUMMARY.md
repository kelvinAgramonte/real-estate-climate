# 📝 Project Summary

This document summarizes the process followed to design, implement, and validate the **Real Estate Listings + Climate Data ETL** solution.  
The goal was to transform a short coding exercise into a fully structured, production-like project.

---

## 1. Repository Setup
- Created a dedicated project folder `battalion/` with a clean structure:
  ```
  ├─ data/            # Input CSVs and enriched JSON output
  ├─ db/              # SQL schema and initialization scripts
  ├─ docs/            # Documentation and diagrams
  ├─ scripts/         # Loader and query helper scripts
  ├─ src/             # Core ETL code (transform, utils)
  ├─ tests/           # Pytest unit tests
  ├─ .github/workflows/ # CI pipeline definition
  ├─ docker-compose.yml
  ├─ .env / .env.example
  ├─ requirements.txt
  └─ README.md
  ```

- Added a `.gitignore` to exclude virtual environments, `__pycache__`, and build artifacts.

---

## 2. Virtual Environment & Dependencies
- Created and activated a Python virtual environment (`.venv`).
- Installed required packages:
  - `pandas` for ETL transformations
  - `mysql-connector-python` for database integration
  - `pytest` for testing
- Verify `requirements.txt` reflects pinned versions.

---

## 3. ETL Development
- Implemented `src/utils.py` and `src/transform.py` to handle:
  - Normalization of APNs (digits only).
  - Filtering on valid status and required fields.
  - Deduplication (keeping lowest price per APN).
  - Enrichment with climate data (left join).
  - Derived fields (`price_per_sqft`, `full_address`).
  - Sorting by price.
- Output: `data/listings_enriched.json`.

---

## 4. Testing
- `tests/test_transform.py` with **pytest**.
- Verified:
  - Normalization logic.
  - Deduplication rules.
  - Derived field calculations.
- Ran `pytest` successfully — **all tests passed** ✅.

---

## 5. Database & Docker Integration
- Added **MySQL 8.0** container via `docker-compose.yml`.
- Created `db/schema.sql` and `db/init.sql` to initialize schema.
- Wrote helper scripts:
  - `scripts/load_to_mysql.py` → loads JSON output into MySQL (`REPLACE INTO` for idempotency).
  - `scripts/query_mysql.py` → runs arbitrary SQL queries from CLI.
- Verified integration:
  - Table creation.
  - JSON load (3 records).
  - Queries for counts, min/max price, groupings by flood zone.

---

## 6. CI Pipeline
- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
  - Installs dependencies.
  - Runs pytest.
  - Builds ETL artifact (`listings_enriched.json`).
- Configured README badge to display CI status.

---

## 7. Documentation & Diagrams
- Wrote `docs/architecture.md` including:
  - System overview.
  - ETL data flow.
  - Local run sequence.
  - Container infrastructure.
  - Repository layout.
- Generated draft diagrams (SVG).
- Created `docs/` folder with structured naming (e.g., `01_system_overview.svg`).

---

## 8. Key Learnings
- Structured even a small exercise into a **production-like repo** with testing, infra, CI, and docs.
- Ensured reproducibility: any developer can clone, run `docker compose up`, run `python -m src.transform`, and query results.

---

✅ **Outcome:**  
A fully working ETL pipeline with reproducible infrastructure, automated testing, and professional documentation.  

---

👉 Next steps (future work):
- Dashboard integration (Confluence / BI tool).
- Extended test coverage.
- Potential cloud deployment (RDS, ECS).
